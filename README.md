WeatherApp is an application designed to provide weather updates based on your current location. It allows users to search for and view weather information for any city of their choice. Additionally, users can save weather details for selected cities, and when an internet connection is available, the app automatically updates the weather conditions for those saved cities. All weather data is stored locally on the device for easy access.
